## Known Limitations

Due to macOS system design, there are some limitations with window activation:

### Window Activation Behavior

| Feature | Behavior | Note |
|---------|----------|------|
| **Profile Opening** | ‚úÖ Only activates the new window | Opens with configurable URL (default: `edge://newtab`) |
| **Workspace Opening** | ‚ö†Ô∏è Activates all Edge windows | macOS limitation - brings all windows forward |
| **Tab Switching** | ‚ö†Ô∏è Activates all Edge windows | macOS limitation - brings all windows forward |

**Why this happens:** 
- macOS is designed to bring all application windows to the front when an app is activated. This is standard behavior across most Mac applications.
- The Profile feature can avoid this by using a special activation method. You can configure which URL to open via the `EDGE_PROFILE_START_URL` setting.
- Workspace and Tab features must use standard activation, which brings all windows forward.

2. Select "Configure..." 
3. Adjust any of the following settings:

| Setting | Description | Default |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| **Profile Start URL** | URL to open when launching a new profile window | `edge://newtab` |

## Troubleshooting

### Profiles not showing up?

- Fully quit Edge and try again (Edge needs to save profile data)

### Workflow not working?
