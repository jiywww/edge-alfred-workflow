### User Configuration Options

* **Profile Start URL**: URL to open when launching a new profile window (default: `edge://newtab`)
* **Python Path**: Path to Python 3 executable (leave empty for system default)
* **Edge Application Path**: Path to Microsoft Edge app (useful for Beta/Canary versions)
* **Edge User Data Directory**: Custom Edge data directory location

## Setup

### System Requirements

* **macOS Big Sur (11.0) or later** - Required for Python 3.9+
* **Microsoft Edge** - Must be installed on your Mac
* **Alfred 5** with Powerpack license

### Required Permissions

When you first use this workflow, macOS will request permission for:

* **Automation Access** - Alfred needs permission to control Microsoft Edge
  * You'll see: "Alfred wants access to control Microsoft Edge"
  * Click "OK" to grant permission
  * If you accidentally deny, go to System Settings ‚Üí Privacy & Security ‚Üí Automation ‚Üí Alfred ‚Üí Enable Microsoft Edge

### Python Requirements

This workflow requires Python 3.9 or later, which is included in macOS Big Sur and later. No additional packages need to be installed.

### Microsoft Edge

Microsoft Edge must be installed on your Mac. The workflow will automatically detect the standard installation location. For Beta or Canary versions, configure the Edge Application Path in the workflow settings.

## Features

### Profile Management

* Search by profile name, email, or directory
* Open profiles in new windows with configurable start URL

### Workspace Management  
* Search workspaces across all profiles

## Known Limitations

Due to macOS system design, there are some limitations with window activation:

| Feature | Behavior | Note |
|---------|----------|------|
| **Profile Opening** | ‚úÖ Only activates the new window | Opens with configurable URL |
| **Workspace Opening** | ‚ö†Ô∏è Activates all Edge windows | macOS limitation |
| **Tab Switching** | ‚ö†Ô∏è Activates all Edge windows | macOS limitation |

This is standard macOS behavior when activating applications. The Profile feature uses a special activation method to avoid this.

## Troubleshooting

### Edge Not Found
* Ensure Microsoft Edge is installed
* For non-standard installations, configure the Edge Application Path

### No Profiles/Workspaces Listed
* Check that Edge has been opened at least once
* Verify the Edge User Data Directory setting if using a custom location

### Python Errors
* Ensure Python 3.9+ is available
* Configure Python Path if using a non-system Python installation

## Privacy & Security

This workflow:
* Only reads Edge configuration files (no modifications)
* Does not store or transmit any user data
* Does not access browsing history or passwords
* Requires no network access
